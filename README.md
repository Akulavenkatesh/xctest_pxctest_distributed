# xctest_pxctest_distributed
Distributed, headless parallel testing for xctest/pxctest

Need to divvy up your XCTests to run against multiple devices which share work/tests among each other for faster runs? Look no further...

## What it does - See line 109 of ios_parallel.py
1. clones your repo
2. checks out a branch
3. pod install
4. builds your workspace (with special test params)
5. builds your simulators and builds lists of tests to execute based on pattern matching "ends with Test" in the tests_dir via JSON config
6. runs tests in parallel via Popen

### Instructions
1. install pxctest - ``brew tap plu/pxctest && brew install pxctest --HEAD``
2. clone my repo - ``git clone https://github.com/apkatsikas/xctest_pxctest_distributed ``
3. edit ios_tests.json - see JSON Instructions
4. run the python file ``python ios_parallel.py``
5. see your results at ``./project/sim_devices/{"number of sim device"}/target/iOS version/ios device/junit.xml``

### JSON Instructions
1. modify "number_of_simulators" to your desired count.Â On my beefy machine, 3 was the max I could pull off.
2. modify "tests_dir" to the expected relative location of your UI tests in your project
3. modiy "directory" to your desired directory where the repo will be cloned/simulators build etc.
4. modify "clone_statement" to the URL of your git repo
5. modify "checkout branch" to the branch you want to test against"
6. modify "project string" to your project string
7. modify all occurences of 'name=iPad Air 2,os=iOS 10.2' to your expected device string
8. modify occurences of -scheme 'project' and -workspace 'project.workspace' and -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPad Air 2,OS=10.2' to your expected values
9. modify occurence of \"project_iphonesimulator10.2-x86_64.xctestrun\" to your output device name
10. modify occurence of "--only 'uitests%s' to your test target string
